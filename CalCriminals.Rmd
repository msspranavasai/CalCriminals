## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### 1. Loading and Initial Data Inspection

```{r load-data}
# Read the data
crimes_data <- read_excel("crimes-ca.xlsx", sheet = "ViolentCrime")

# Display the first few rows and basic information about the dataset
head(crimes_data) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)

# Display structure of the data
str(crimes_data)
```

### 2. Data Quality Assessment
```{r data-quality}
# Check for missing values
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(crimes_data))
missing_values_df <- data.frame(
  Column = names(missing_values),
  Missing_Values = missing_values
)

# Display missing values
missing_values_df %>%
  kable(caption = "Missing Values by Column") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)

# Check for duplicate rows
duplicate_count <- sum(duplicated(crimes_data))
cat("Number of duplicate rows:", duplicate_count, "\n")
```

### 3. Data Cleaning

```{r data-cleaning, echo=TRUE}
# Clean the data step by step

# 1. Convert the data to a data frame
cleaned_crimes <- as.data.frame(crimes_data)

# 2. Inspect column names for debugging
colnames(cleaned_crimes)

# 3. Handle missing values and duplicates
cleaned_crimes <- cleaned_crimes %>%
  drop_na() %>%     # Remove rows with missing values
  distinct()        # Remove duplicate rows

# 4. Use 'reportyear' instead of 'year' for the year information
# Create crime rate and ensure 'reportyear' is numeric
cleaned_crimes <- cleaned_crimes %>%
  mutate(
    crime_rate = (numerator / denominator) * 100000,
    reportyear = as.integer(reportyear) # Convert reportyear to integer
  )

# 5. Rename columns for clarity
cleaned_crimes <- cleaned_crimes %>%
  rename(
    year = reportyear,        # Rename reportyear to year for consistency
    crime_count = numerator,
    population = denominator,
    crime_type = strata_level_name
  )

# 6. Select and organize final columns
cleaned_crimes <- cleaned_crimes %>%
  select(
    year,
    region_name,
    county_name,
    crime_type,
    crime_count,
    population,
    crime_rate
  )

nrow(cleaned_crimes)
ncol(cleaned_crimes)

# Display summary of the cleaned data
summary(cleaned_crimes) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)
```

### 4. Data Transformation and Feature Engineering
```{r data-transformation}
# Create aggregated datasets for different analyses
yearly_totals <- cleaned_crimes %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    total_crimes = sum(crime_count),
    total_population = sum(population),
    avg_crime_rate = mean(crime_rate)

  group_by(region_name) %>%
  summarise(
    total_crimes = sum(crime_count),
    avg_population = mean(population),
    avg_crime_rate = mean(crime_rate)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_crimes))

crime_type_totals <- cleaned_crimes %>%
  group_by(crime_type) %>%
  summarise(
    total_incidents = sum(crime_count),
    avg_rate = mean(crime_rate)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_incidents))

# Display summaries
kable(head(yearly_totals), caption = "Yearly Crime Totals") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)

kable(head(regional_totals), caption = "Regional Crime Totals") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)

kable(head(crime_type_totals), caption = "Crime Type Totals") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)
```

### 5. Data Quality Verification
```{r data-verification}
# Verify data quality after cleaning
verification_summary <- cleaned_crimes %>%
  summarise(
    row_count = n(),
    distinct_years = n_distinct(year),
    distinct_regions = n_distinct(region_name),
    distinct_counties = n_distinct(county_name),
    distinct_crime_types = n_distinct(crime_type),
    min_year = min(year),
    max_year = max(year),
    min_crime_rate = min(crime_rate),
    max_crime_rate = max(crime_rate)
  )

# Display verification summary
kable(verification_summary, caption = "Data Quality Verification Summary") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)
```

### 6. Save Cleaned Data
```{r save-data}

  ) +
  theme_minimal()

crime_trend_plot

```

### 3. Regional Analysis
```{r}
# Aggregate regional crime data
regional_crime_data <- cleaned_crimes %>%
  group_by(region_name) %>%
  summarise(total_crimes = sum(crime_count))

# Save regional crime data to a CSV file
write.csv(regional_crime_data, "regional_crime_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Crime distribution across regions
regional_crime_plot <- regional_crime_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(region_name, -total_crimes), y = total_crimes, fill = region_name)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Crime Distribution Across Regions",
    x = "Region",
    y = "Total Crimes"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_flip()

regional_crime_plot


```

### 4. Trends Over Time
```{r eda-trends-over-time}
# Analyze crime trends over time
ggplot(yearly_totals, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = total_crimes, color = "Total Crimes"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_crime_rate * 1000, color = "Average Crime Rate (scaled)"), size = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Counts and Rates",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ ./1000, name = "Average Crime Rate (per 100,000)")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Crime Trends Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Total Crimes",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 5. Plot crime type distribution
```{r}
ggplot(crime_type_totals, aes(x = reorder(crime_type, -total_incidents), y = total_incidents, fill = crime_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Crime Types",
    x = "Crime Type",
    y = "Total Incidents"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_flip()
```

### 6. Correlation between crime rate and population
```{r}
ggplot(cleaned_crimes, aes(x = population, y = crime_rate)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Correlation Between Population and Crime Rate",
    x = "Population",
    y = "Crime Rate (per 100,000)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Visualization & Interpretation

#### 1. Scatter Plot with Linear Regression Trendline
```{r}
ggplot(cleaned_crimes %>% filter(population <= quantile(population, 0.99), 
                                 crime_count <= quantile(crime_count, 0.99)), 
       aes(x = population, y = crime_count)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "darkgreen") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "orange") +
  labs(
    title = "Population vs Crime Count",
    x = "Population",
    y = "Crime Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

##### Interpretation:
  - There is a positive correlation between population and the number of crimes, indicating that more populous areas tend to report more crimes.
  - The orange regression line shows the overall trend, suggesting that crime count increases linearly with population size.
  - Outliers with high population but relatively lower crime counts suggest possible variations in law enforcement or unreported crimes.

#### 2. Time Series Chart for Crime Rates by Region
```{r}
ggplot(cleaned_crimes, aes(x = year, y = crime_rate, color = region_name)) +
  geom_line(stat = "summary", fun = "mean", size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ region_name, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Crime Rate Distribution Over Time by Region",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Crime Rate"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

#### Interpretation:

  - Crime rates vary significantly across regions, with certain regions consistently showing higher averages over the years.
  - Some regions exhibit a decreasing trend in crime rates, indicating potential improvements in public safety measures.
  - Peaks in crime rates during specific years may correspond to societal or economic factors affecting the respective regions.

#### 3. Crime Count By County - Bar Chart
```{r}
top_counties <- cleaned_crimes %>%
  group_by(county_name) %>%
  summarise(total_crimes = sum(crime_count)) %>%
  top_n(10, total_crimes)

ggplot(top_counties, aes(x = reorder(county_name, -total_crimes), y = total_crimes, fill = county_name)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 10 Counties by Total Crimes",
    x = "County",
    y = "Total Crimes"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_flip()
```

#### Interpretation:
  - The top 10 counties contribute disproportionately to the total number of crimes, suggesting regional hotspots for criminal activity.
  - Counties with higher crime counts may require targeted interventions to address local factors driving crime.
  - Variations in crime counts among the top counties highlight regional disparities in crime incidence.

#### 4. Crime Rate Heatmap 
```{r}
regional_crime_heatmap <- cleaned_crimes %>%
  group_by(year, region_name) %>%
  summarise(mean_crime_rate = mean(crime_rate))

ggplot(regional_crime_heatmap, aes(x = year, y = region_name, fill = mean_crime_rate)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma", name = "Mean Crime Rate") +
  labs(
    title = "Crime Rate Heatmap by Region and Year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Region"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Interpretation:
  - Certain regions consistently display higher mean crime rates, visible through darker shades on the heatmap.
  - Temporal patterns, such as year-over-year increases or decreases, are evident for some regions, aiding in trend analysis.
  - The visualization emphasizes the need for region-specific strategies to reduce crime rates effectively.

#### 5. Box Plot for Yearwise Crime Count Distribution
```{r}
ggplot(cleaned_crimes %>% filter(crime_rate <= quantile(crime_rate, 0.99)), 
       aes(x = factor(year), y = crime_rate)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Yearly Crime Rate Distribution (Without Outliers)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Crime Rate (per 100,000)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

#### Interpretation:
- Median crime rates have remained relatively stable over the years, as indicated by the consistent interquartile range.
- The presence of outliers suggests occasional surges in crime rates in certain areas or years.
- A reduction in the range of crime rates in recent years may indicate improved consistency in law enforcement efforts.


#### 6. Density Plot
```{r}
ggplot(cleaned_crimes, aes(x = crime_rate)) +
  geom_density(fill = "orange", alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(~ region_name, scales = "free") +
  labs(
    title = "Crime Rate Density by Region",
    x = "Crime Rate",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Interpretation:
  - Crime rate distributions vary widely across regions, with some regions showing a higher concentration of low crime rates.
  - Regions with multiple density peaks indicate diverse sub-regions with differing crime dynamics.
  - Overlapping densities suggest shared trends in crime rates among geographically or demographically similar regions.


#### 7. Line Chart for Crime Rates over years in different Counties
```{r}
ggplot(cleaned_crimes, aes(x = year, y = crime_rate, group = region_name, color = region_name)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ region_name, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Crime Rates Over Years by Region",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Crime Rate (per 100,000)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

#### Interpretation:
Crime rate trends are inconsistent across counties, with some exhibiting steady declines while others fluctuate significantly. Seasonal or policy-related effects could explain periodic spikes in certain counties.Differences in trend slopes indicate varying effectiveness of crime prevention strategies among counties.

#### 8. County-wise Crime Rate Heatmap
```{r}
crime_heatmap_data <- cleaned_crimes %>%
  group_by(year, county_name) %>%
  summarise(total_crimes = sum(crime_count)) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(crime_heatmap_data, aes(x = year, y = county_name, fill = total_crimes)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma", name = "Total Crimes") +
  labs(
    title = "Crime Counts by County and Year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "County"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

#### Interpretation:
  - Counties with darker cells show persistently high crime counts across multiple years, pinpointing areas needing immediate attention.
  - Temporal trends, such as periods of rising or falling crime counts, are clearly visible for each county.
  - The heatmap highlights counties that consistently perform better or worse in crime rate management.

#### 9. Crime Types Pie Chart
```{r}
# Aggregate data by crime type, including "Violent crime total"
crime_type_totals <- crimes_data %>%
  group_by(strata_level_name) %>%
  summarise(
    total_incidents = sum(numerator, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(total_incidents > 0) # Ensure valid totals

# Calculate percentages and update legend labels
crime_type_totals <- crime_type_totals %>%
  mutate(
    percentage = total_incidents / sum(total_incidents) * 100,
    legend_label = sprintf("%s (%.1f%%)", strata_level_name, percentage), # Attach percentage to name
    label = sprintf("%.1f%%", percentage) # Only display percentage in the pie chart
  )

# Create the improved pie chart
ggplot(crime_type_totals, aes(x = "", y = total_incidents, fill = legend_label)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1, color = "white") + # Add white border for better slice separation
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") + # Use a visually distinct palette
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Crime Types",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    fill = "Crime Type" # Updated legend with percentages
  ) +
  theme_void() + # Remove unnecessary chart elements
  theme(
    legend.position = "right",
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5) # Center and bold title
  ) 
```

#### Interpretation:
  - The chart effectively showcases the proportional contribution of each crime type to the total incidents.
  - Dominance of certain crime types, such as "violent crime," reflects areas requiring focused interventions.
  - Smaller slices emphasize less frequent crimes, highlighting diverse but less prevalent criminal activities.

#### 10. Bar Chart Representing Top Counties with Highest Crime Rates
```{r}
top_counties <- cleaned_crimes %>%
  group_by(county_name) %>%
  summarise(avg_crime_rate = mean(crime_rate)) %>%
  top_n(10, avg_crime_rate) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_crime_rate))

ggplot(top_counties, aes(x = reorder(county_name, avg_crime_rate), y = avg_crime_rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#8B0000") +
  labs(
    title = "Top Counties with Highest Average Crime Rates",
    x = "County",
    y = "Average Crime Rate (per 100,000)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()

```

#### Interpretation:
  - The top counties with the highest average crime rates may require enhanced resources or policy changes to address persistent issues.
  - Disparities among counties indicate the unequal distribution of crime challenges across the state.
  - This chart provides a clear indication of areas where preventive measures could significantly impact overall crime rates.

#### 11. Crime Count Over Time by Crime Type
```{r}
# Ensure necessary columns are present and rename for clarity
cleaned_crimes2 <- crimes_data %>%
  rename(
    year = reportyear,
    crime_type = strata_level_name,
    crime_count = numerator
  ) %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(year), # Remove rows with missing years
    !is.na(crime_count), # Remove rows with missing crime counts
    !is.na(crime_type) # Remove rows with missing crime types
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year), # Ensure year is an integer for plotting
    crime_count = as.numeric(crime_count) # Ensure crime_count is numeric
  )

# Create the area plot
ggplot(cleaned_crimes2, aes(x = year, y = crime_count, fill = crime_type)) +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.7, position = "stack") + # Stacked area chart
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") + # Use a clear, professional color palette
  labs(
    title = "Crime Counts Over Time by Crime Type",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Total Crimes",
    fill = "Crime Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() + # Use a minimal theme for clean visualization
  theme(
    legend.position = "right",
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5), # Center and bold title
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1) # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability
  )

```

#### Interpretation:
  - Crime types have varied contributions over time, with some showing increasing trends while others remain constant or decrease.
  - Periodic rises in specific crime types may correlate with policy changes or societal shifts.
  - The stacked area chart helps visualize the relative dominance of each crime type over the years, aiding in prioritization of resources.

## Conclusion
