# Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze crime rates in California using data from official records to identify trends and patterns in criminal activity. Understanding crime rates is essential for enhancing public safety, allocating law enforcement resources effectively, and identifying key factors contributing to violent crimes. With crime remaining a critical societal concern, this analysis aims to provide insights into the factors influencing crime rates and geographic disparities.

In pursuit of this goal, we conducted comprehensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis of crime datasets in California. Our analysis focuses on answering the following questions:

  1. What are the overall trends in violent crime rates across the years in California?
  2. Are there regional disparities in crime rates across counties or cities?
  3. What types of violent crimes are most prevalent, and how do they compare across different areas?
  4. How does population size correlate with crime rates? Are more populated areas inherently at higher risk for crime?
  5. Are there differences in crime rates based on demographic factors such as race or ethnicity?
  
By exploring these key questions, our project aims to uncover meaningful patterns and provide actionable insights that can support policymakers, law enforcement, and community initiatives to reduce crime rates and ensure public safety.

# Data

### **Structure**
The dataset used for this project is available at [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/violent-crime-rate-9a68e). The portal provides data on various aspects of crime, including violent crime rates, demographic breakdowns, and geographic trends. The data spans multiple years, with comprehensive details for each yearâ€™s reported crimes.

For this analysis, we chose to focus on data from the years 2000 to 2013. This time frame provides a recent and consistent dataset, ensuring that reporting methodologies remain stable and comparable across the years. Additionally, analyzing 17 years of data allows us to observe meaningful trends over time without overwhelming the analysis with an unmanageable volume of information.

The dataset contains information from multiple aspects of crime reporting, but to streamline our analysis, we focused on the variables most relevant to violent crimes. These variables include:

  - **Crime Type and Rate**: Details about the type of violent crimes (e.g., assault, homicide) and their rates per population.
  - **Geographic Information**: Data on counties and regions where the crimes were reported.
  - **Demographics**: Breakdowns of reported crime rates based on race and ethnicity, providing insights into population-specific trends.
  - **Population Data**: Information about the population size for each geographic region to allow for normalization of crime rates.

The structure of the data is such that each row represents a reported crime in a specific year and region, while other variables provide detailed information about the crime. To keep the dataset manageable, we focused on violent crime categories and excluded variables unrelated to our analysis goals.

By carefully selecting the data and time frame, we created a cohesive and focused dataset that enables us to effectively analyze trends and patterns in violent crime rates across California.

### **Data Processing**
- Explain any steps taken to clean or preprocess the data:
  - Handling missing values
  - Transformations or filtering
  - Feature engineering, if applicable
